## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Object Detection:**  
  Trained with TensorFlowâ€™s **ResNet 640Ã—640** architecture.  
  Dataset was **self-collected** and annotated using **LabelImg** for:
  - Car Logos
  - Number Plates  

- **Logo Brand Classification:**  
  Used **Xception CNN architecture** (an advanced version of Inception V3).  
  Trained to predict one of 8 brands:  
  > Hyundai, Lexus, Mercedes, Opel, Skoda, Toyota, Volkswagen, Mazda  
  Achieved **86% validation accuracy**.

- **Number Plate Recognition:**  
  Used **EasyOCR** to read and produce text from number plates.

- **Deployment:**  
  Integrated with **Gradio Interface** for quick detection demos.
